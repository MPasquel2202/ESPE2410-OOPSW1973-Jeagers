# Project Title
Pro-manager

## Description
In the telecommunications field, there are several areas, but this project will focus on a project manager. The automation of project scheduling and the generation of comprehensive reports about one or more projects are vital for management and executives in the telecommunications company to make better decisions. In addition, these reports are useful for tracking the status of projects, from sending prototypes and budgets to the client, to invoicing and potential project follow-up.
